Here is where i will put all my projects and road to gameDev
i will start learning each mechanics at a time
projects to be used to learn this mechanics:

proj__GameMechanics/
	* learn how procedural terrain generation with meshs and marching cubes is implemented
		> Perlin Noise
		> Height map
		> colour map
		> Mesh map
		> Infinite Terrain
		> Chunk Load and Unload
		> LOD(Level Of Detail)
		> normals
		> colliders
	* learn about chacter movement, 3rd person and 1st person
	* learn how animate  a game character: jumping, choping, havesting, building, smithing, etc.
	* learn how implement game mechanics like: health, thirst, stamina, hunger, sprint, jump, etc.
	* learn how implement post-processing and graphic effects
		> Shader computing
		> Unity URP
		> Physics
		> Lighting and Reflection
		> DOF(Depth of Field)

game__SmithAndCraft/
	* create a game prototype implementing the mecanics learned in a real project
