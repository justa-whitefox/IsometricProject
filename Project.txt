[World lore]	
	* a fallout-like world that has been filled with radiation by an unparalleled nuclear war
	* the manKing, survive on underground, with machines and tecnology created during the war, without know that there is survivals in the surface, those who mutated to stronger, with animals-like caracteristics that help then to survive in a world filled with lethal creatures who follow the law of jungle,
